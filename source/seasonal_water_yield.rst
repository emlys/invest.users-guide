Seasonal Water Yield
********************

Summary
=======

There is a high demand for tools estimating the effect of landscape
management on the water supply service, for uses like irrigation, domestic consumption and
hydropower production. While the InVEST Annual Water Yield model
provides an estimate of total water yield for a catchment, many
applications require knowledge of seasonal flows, especially during the
dry season. This requires the understanding of hydrological processes in
a catchment, in particular the partitioning between quickflow
(occurring during or shortly after rain events) and baseflow (occurring
during dry weather). In highly seasonal climates, baseflow is likely to
provide greater value than quickflow, unless significant storage
(e.g., a large reservoir) is available. The InVEST Seasonal Water Yield
model seeks to provide guidance regarding the contribution of land
parcels to the generation of both baseflow and quickflow. The model
computes spatial indices that quantify the relative contribution of a
parcel of land to the generation of both baseflow and quickflow.
Currently, there are no quantitative estimates of baseflow, only the
relative contributions of pixels; a separate tool is in development to
address this question.

Introduction
============

Understanding the effect of landscape management on seasonal flow is of
critical importance for watershed management. The contribution of a
given parcel to streamflow depends on a number of environmental factors
including climate, soil, vegetation, slope, and position along the flow
path (determining if the pixel may receive water from upslope or if
water recharged may later be evapotranspired).

Water flowing across the landscape is either evaporated, transpired,
withdrawn by a well, or leaves the watershed as deep groundwater flow or
streamflow. If we consider an individual pixel, and its value with
respect to water yield, we can consider two approaches:

-  The first gives credit to the net amount of water generated on a
   pixel as equal to the incoming precipitation minus the losses to
   evapotranspiration on that pixel. In this scheme, it is possible for
   actual evapotranspiration to be greater than precipitation if water
   is supplied to the site from upslope. Thus, the net generation
   could be negative. This approach pays no heed to the eventual
   disposition of that water generated on that pixel; that is, it does
   not consider whether the water actually shows up as streamflow or is
   evaporated or withdrawn somewhere along its path.

-  The second approach gives credit to the water from a parcel that
   actually shows up as streamflow. Thus, if a parcel generates water
   that is later evaporated, the contribution is considered to be nil.

The former approach puts greater emphasis on the land-use and land-cover
of a site, since the focus is on net generation from that pixel. It
accounts for the subsidy of water from upslope pixels, but does not
consider downslope effects. It represents the *potential* to generate
streamflow (not an actual generation of flow).

The second approach puts more emphasis on the topographic position of a
pixel, as that will determine the potential for water generated on that
pixel to be consumed before becoming streamflow. It represents the
actual streamflow generated by a pixel. Since actual streamflow cannot
be less than zero, this approach, unlike the first, will result in
indices that are greater than or equal to zero.

We use both of these concepts to develop a set of three indices, one for
quickflow, one for recharge (which represents the ‘potential baseflow’),
and one for actual baseflow. Here, baseflow is defined as the generation
of streamflow with watershed residence times of months to years, while
quickflow represents the generation of streamflow with watershed
residence times of hours to days.


The Model
=========

Quickflow
---------

*Quickflow* (QF) is calculated with a Curve Number (CN)-based approach. Monthly rain events cause precipitation to fall on the landscape. Soil and land cover properties determine how much of the rain runs off of the land surface quickly (producing quickflow) versus infiltrating into the soil (producing local recharge.) The curve number is a simple way of capturing these soil + land cover properties - higher values of CN have higher runoff potential (for example, clay soils and low vegetation cover), lower values are more likely to infiltrate (for example, sandy soils and dense vegetation cover.)

To calculate quickflow, we use the mean event depth, :math:`\frac{P_{i,m}}{n_{i,m}}` and assume an exponential
distribution of daily precipitation depths on days with rain,

.. math:: f\left( p \right) = \frac{1}{a_{i,m}}exp\left( - \frac{p}{a_{i,m}} \right)

Where :math:`a_{i,m} = \frac{P_{i,m}}{n_{m}}/25.4` and

-  :math:`a_{i,m}` is the mean rain depth on a rainy day at pixel
   *i* on month *m* [in],

-  :math:`n_{i,m}` is the number of events at pixel *i* in month *m*
   [-],

-  :math:`P_{i,m}` is the monthly precipitation for pixel *i* at month
   *m* [mm].

Quickflow for pixels located in streams is set to the precipitation on
that pixel, which assumes no infiltration, only runoff.

.. math:: \text{QF}_{stream,m} = \ P_{stream,m}

otherwise it can be shown from the exponential distribution that the
monthly runoff :math:`\text{QF}_{i,m}` is

.. math:: \text{QF}_{i,m} = n_{m} \times \left( \left( a_{i,m} - S_{i} \right)\exp\left( - \frac{0.2S_{i}}{a_{i,m}} \right) + \frac{S_{i}^{2}}{a_{i,m}}\exp\left( \frac{0.8S_{i}}{a_{i,m}} \right)E_{1}\left( \frac{S_{i}}{a_{i,m}} \right) \right) \times \left( 25.4\ \left\lbrack \frac{\text{mm}}{\text{in}} \right\rbrack \right)
	:label: (swy. 1)

where

-  :math:`S_{i} = \frac{1000}{\text{CN}_{i}} - 10` [in]

-  :math:`\text{CN}_{i}` is the curve number for pixel *i*
   [in\ :sup:`-1`\], tabulated as a function of the local LULC, and soil type
   *(see Appendix I for a template of this table)*,

-  :math:`E_{1}` is the exponential integral function,
   :math:`E_{1}(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty}{\frac{e^{-xt}}{t}\text{dt}}`.

- and :math:`25.4` is a conversion factor from inches (used by the equation) to millimeters (used by the model)

Thus the annual quick flow :math:`\text{QF}_{i}`, can be calculated from
the sum of monthly :math:`\text{QF}_{i,m}` values,

.. math:: \text{QF}_{i} = \sum_{m = 1}^{12}{QF_{i,m}}
	:label: (swy. 2)


Local recharge
--------------

The *local* *recharge,* or potential contribution to baseflow, of a
pixel is computed from the local water balance. Precipitation that does not run off as quickflow, and is not evapotranspired by the vegetation on a pixel, can infiltrate the soil to become local recharge. Local recharge can be negative if a pixel does not receive enough of its own water to satisfy its vegetation requirements (determined by its crop factor *Kc*), so it uses water generated upslope of the pixel as well (referred to as an "upslope subsidy".) The local recharge index is computed on an annual time scale, but uses values derived from monthly water budgets.

For a pixel *i*, the local recharge derived from the annual water budget
is (Figure 1):

.. math:: L_{i} = P_{i} - \text{QF}_{i} - \text{AET}_{i}
	:label: (swy. 3)


Where annual actual evapotranspiration AET is the sum of monthly AET:

.. math:: \text{AET}_{i} = \sum_{\text{months}}^{}\text{AET}_{i,m}
	:label: (swy. 4)


For each month, :math:`\text{AET}_{i,m}` is either limited by the demand
(potential evapotranspiration - PET) or by the available water (from Allen et al. 1998):

.. math:: \text{AET}_{i,m} = min(\text{PET}_{i,m}\ ;\ P_{i,m} - \text{QF}_{i,m} + \alpha_{m}\beta_{i}L_{sum.avail,i})
	:label: (swy. 5)


Where :math:`\text{PET}_{i,m}` is the monthly potential
evapotranspiration,

.. math:: \text{PET}_{i,m} = K_{c,i,m} \times ET_{0,i,m}
	:label: (swy. 6)


:math:`L_{sum.avail,i}` is recursively defined by (Figure 2),

.. math:: L_{sum.avail,i} = \sum_{j \in \{ neighbor\ pixels\ draining\ to\ pixel\ i\}}^{}{p_{\text{ij}} \cdot \left( L_{avail,j} + L_{sum.avail,j} \right)}
	:label: (swy. 7)


where :math:`p_{\text{ij}}\  \in \lbrack 0,1\rbrack` is the proportion
of flow from cell *i* to *j*, and :math:`L_{avail,i}` is the available
recharge to a pixel, which is :math:`L_{i}` whenever :math:`L_{i}` is negative, and
a proportion :math:`\gamma` of :math:`L_{i}` when it is positive (see
below for definition of :math:`\gamma`):

.. math:: L_{avail,i}\  = min(\gamma L_{i},L_{i})
	:label: (swy. 8)


In the above:

-  :math:`P_{i}` and :math:`P_{i,m}` are the annual and monthly
   precipitation, respectively [mm]

-  :math:`\text{QF}_{i}` and :math:`\text{QF}_{i,m}` are the quickflow
   indices, defined above [mm]

-  :math:`ET_{0,i,m}` is the reference evapotranspiration for month m
   [mm]

-  :math:`K_{c,i,m}` is the monthly crop factor for the pixel’s LULC

-  :math:`\alpha_{m}` is the fraction of upslope annual available
   recharge that is available in month m (default is 1/12)

-  :math:`\beta_{i}` is the fraction of the upslope subsidy that is
   available for downslope evapotranspiration (default is 1; see
   Appendix II for more information)

-  γ is the fraction of pixel recharge that is available to downslope
   pixels (default is 1)

Attribution of recharge
-----------------------

The total baseflow, :math:`Q_b` (in mm), is the average of the contributing local
recharges (negative or positive) in the catchment,

.. math:: Q_{b} = \frac{\sum_{k \in \left\{ \text{pixels in catchment} \right\}}^{}L_{k}}{n_{\text{pixels in catchment}}}
	:label: (swy. 9)

Attribution value to a pixel is the relative contribution of local recharge :math:`L` on that pixel to the
baseflow :math:`Q_b`:

.. math:: V_{R,i} = \frac{L_{i}}{{Q_{b} \times n}_{\text{pixels in catchment}}}
	:label: (swy. 10)

contribution, see Eq. 5) and baseflow (based on Bsum, the flow

|
|

Baseflow
--------

The baseflow index represents the contribution of a pixel to
baseflow (i.e. water that reaches the stream during the dry season). If the local recharge is
negative, then the pixel did not contribute to baseflow so :math:`B` is set to
zero. If the pixel contributed to groundwater recharge, then :math:`B` is a
function of the amount of flow leaving the pixel and of the relative
contribution to recharge of this pixel.

For a pixel that is not adjacent to the stream channel, the cumulative
baseflow, :math:`B_{sum,i}`, is proportional to the cumulative baseflow
leaving the adjacent downslope pixels minus the cumulative baseflow
that was generated on that same downslope pixel (Figure 2):

.. math::
   B_{sum,i} = L_{sum,i}\sum_{j \in \{\text{cells to which cell i pours}\}}^{}\begin{Bmatrix}
   p_{\text{ij}}\left( 1 - \frac{L_{avail,j}}{L_{sum,j}} \right)\frac{B_{sum,j}}{L_{sum,j} - L_{j}}\ \text{   if }j\text{ is a nonstream pixel} \\
   p_{\text{ij}}\ \text{   if }j\text{ is a stream pixel} \\
   \end{Bmatrix}
 :label: (swy. 11)

At the watershed outlet (or at any pixel adjacent to the stream), the
sum of baseflow generation :math:`B_{sum,i}` over all upslope pixels
is equal to the sum of local generation over the same pixels (because
there is no further opportunity for the slow flow to be consumed before
reaching the stream):

.. math:: B_{sum,outlet} = L_{sum,outlet}
	:label: (swy. 12)


where :math:`L_{sum,i}` is the cumulative upstream recharge defined by

.. math:: L_{sum,i} = L_{i} + \sum_{j,\ all\ pixels\ draining\ to\ pixel\ i}^{}{L_{sum,j} \cdot p_{\text{ji}}}
	:label: (swy. 13)


and the baseflow, :math:`B_{i}` can be directly derived from the
proportion of the cumulative baseflow leaving cell *i*, with respect to
the available recharge to the upstream cumulative recharge:

.. math:: B_{i} = max\left(B_{sum,i} \cdot \frac{L_{i}}{L_{sum,i}}, 0\right)
	:label: (swy. 14)


Limitations
-----------

Like all InVEST models, Seasonal Water Yield uses a simplified approach to estimating quickflow and baseflow, and does not include many of the complexities that occur as water moves through a landscape. Quickflow is primarily based on curve number, which does not take topography into account. For baseflow, although the model uses a physics-based approach, the equations are extremely simplified at both spatial and temporal scales, which significantly increases the uncertainty on the absolute numbers produced. So we do not suggest to use the absolute values, but instead the relative values across the landscapes (where we assume that the simplifications matter less, because they apply to the entire landscape).


Calibration
-----------

It is always recommended to validate against observed data if possible. However, while the quickflow output from the model may be used as a quantitative measure, baseflow is intended to be used as an index, not an absolute value. So it is difficult to combine quickflow and baseflow and expect to get realistic model results for validating against observed flow. One possibility is to validate the relative values (i.e. the distribution of values across the landscape). This requires several (at least >3, more realistically >5) stream gauges, which can be compared with the quickflow and baseflow outputs of the model, aggregated to the same stream gauge points. Alternatively, results may be compared to a different spatially-explicit model, if it is available.

If you do try quantitatively validating either quickflow, or a combination of quickflow and baseflow (again, not recommended, but people do try), note that since the results are in millimeters, if we simply sum these up over the whole area, the result is likely to be orders of magnitude too large, and doesn’t represent the total water volume properly. Instead, use the *mean* B or Qf value across the watershed, convert millimeters to meters, then multiply by the watershed area to get a value in cubic meters, which can be compared against observed flow data. Alternatively, you could calculate volume per pixel and sum those.


Data needs
==========

This section outlines the specific data used by the model. See Appendix 1 for additional information on data sources and pre-processing. Please consult the InVEST sample data (located in the folder where InVEST is installed, if you also chose to install sample data) for examples of all of these data inputs. This will help with file type, folder structure and table formatting. Note that all GIS inputs must be in the same projected coordinate system and in linear meter units.

- **Workspace** (required). Folder where model outputs will be written. Make sure that there is ample disk space, and write permissions are correct.

- **Suffix** (optional). Text string that will be appended to the end of output file names, as "\_Suffix". Use a Suffix to differentiate model runs, for example by providing a short name for each scenario. If a Suffix is not provided, or changed between model runs, the tool will overwrite previous results.

- **Precipitation Directory** (required). Folder containing 12 rasters of monthly precipitation for each pixel.  Raster file names must end with the month number (e.g. Precip_1.tif for January.) Only .tif files should be in this folder (no .tfw, .xml, etc files). [units: millimeters]

- **ET0 directory** (required). Folder containing 12 rasters of monthly reference evapotranspiration for each pixel. Raster file names must end with the month number (e.g. ET0_1.tif for January.) Only .tif files should be in this folder (no .tfw, .xml, etc files). [units: millimeters]

- **Digital Elevation Model** (required). Raster of elevation for each pixel. Floating point or integer values. [units: meters]

- **Land use/land cover** (required). Raster of land use/land cover (LULC) for each pixel, where each unique integer represents a different land use/land cover class. *All values in this raster MUST have corresponding entries in the Biophysical table.*

- **Soil group** (required). Raster of SCS soil hydrologic groups (A, B, C, or D), used in combination with the LULC map to compute the curve number (CN) raster. This is a raster of integers where values are entered as numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, corresponding to soil groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. No other numbers other than 1-4 are allowed, See Appendix 1 for more information. 

- **AOI/Watershed** (required). Shapefile delineating the boundary of the watershed to be modeled. Results will be aggregated within each polygon defined. The column *ws_id* is required, containing a unique integer value for each polygon.

- **Biophysical table** (required). A .csv (Comma Separated Value) table containing model information corresponding to each of the land use classes in the LULC raster. *All LULC classes in the LULC raster MUST have corresponding values in this table.* Each row is a land use/land cover class and columns must be named and defined as follows:

	- *lucode* (required). Unique integer for each LULC class (e.g., 1 for forest, 3 for grassland, etc.) *Every value in the LULC map MUST have a corresponding lucode value in the biophysical table.*
	- *CN\_A*, *CN\_B*, *CN\_C*, *CN\_D* (required). Integer curve number (CN) values for each combination of soil type and **lucode** class. No 0s (zeroes) are allowed.
	- *Kc\_1*, *Kc\_2*... *Kc\_11*, *Kc\_12* (required). Floating point monthly crop/vegetation coefficient (Kc) values for each *lucode*. *Kc\_1* corresponds to January, *Kc\_2* February, etc.

- **Rain events table** (either this or a Climate Zone table is required). CSV (comma-separated value, .csv) table with 12 values of rain events, one per month. A rain event is defined as >0.1mm. The following fields are required:

	- *month* (required). Values are the integer numbers 1 through 12, corresponding to January (1) through December (12)
	- *events* (required). The number of rain events for that month, which are floating point or integer values

- **Threshold flow accumulation** (required). The number of upstream cells that must flow into a cell before it is considered part of a stream, which is used to create streams from the DEM. Smaller values create more tributaries, larger values create fewer. Integer value. See Appendix 1 for more information on choosing this value. Integer value, with no commas or periods - for example "1000".

- **alpha_m**, **beta_i**, **gamma** (required). Model parameters used for research and calibration purposes. Default values are: *alpha_m* = 1/12, *beta_i* = 1,  *gamma* = 1. *alpha_m* is type string; *beta_i* and *gamma* are type floating point.



Advanced model options
----------------------

One model input is the number of rain events per month, which is entered
as a .csv table with one number for each month of the year. This assumes
that there is one such number for the whole watershed, which may not be
true for large areas or areas with very spatially variable precipitation.

To represent variability in the number of rain events, it is possible to
enter a map of climate zones, and associated number of rain events for
each zone.

**Inputs**

- **Climate zone table** (either this or a Rain Events table is required). CSV (comma-separated value, .csv) table with the number of rain events per month and climate zone, with the following required fields:

	- *cz\_id*. Climate zone numbers, integers which correspond to values found in the Climate zone raster
	- *jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec*. 12 fields corresponding to each month of the year. These contain the number of rain events that occur in that month in that climate zone. Floating point.

- **Climate zone**. Raster of climate zones, each uniquely identified by an integer (i.e. all pixels that are part of one climate zone should have the same integer value.) Must match *cz\_id* values in the Climate zone table.

|

The model computes sequentially the local recharge layer, and then the
baseflow layer from local recharge. Instead of InVEST calculating local recharge, this layer could be
obtained from a different model (e.g, RHESSys.) To compute baseflow contribution based on your own recharge layer, it
is possible to bypass the first part of the model and directly enter a map of local recharge.

**Inputs**

- **Local recharge**. Raster with the local recharge obtained from a different model (in mm). Floating point values.

|

The *alpha* parameter represents the temporal variability in the
contribution of upslope available water to evapotranspiration on a
pixel. In the default parameterization, its value is set to 1/12,
assuming that the soil buffers water release and that the monthly
contribution is exactly 1\\12\ :sup:`th` of the annual contribution.

To allow upslope subsidy to be temporally variable instead, the user can enter
monthly *alpha* values, in the same table as the rain events
table.

**Inputs**

- **Rain events table**. The rain events table is a CSV (comma-separated value, .csv) model input (see above). Along with the required *month* field, one additional column named *alpha* is required to run this advanced option. Values for *alpha* are floating point.


Running the model
=================

To launch the Seasonal Water Yield model navigate to the Windows Start Menu -> All Programs -> InVEST [*version*] -> Seasonal Water Yield. The interface does not require a GIS desktop, although the results will need to be explored with any GIS tool such as ArcGIS or QGIS.

Appendix 1: Data sources and guidance for parameter selection
=============================================================

This is a rough compilation of data sources and suggestions about finding, compiling, and formatting data, providing links to global datasets that can get you started. It is highly recommended to look for more local and accurate data (from national, state, university, literature, NGO and other sources) and only use global data for final analyses if nothing more local is available.


Monthly precipitation
---------------------

Global monthly precipitation data can be obtained from the WorldClim dataset: https://www.worldclim.org/ or Climatic Research Unit: http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk.

Alternatively, rasters can be interpolated from rain gauge points with long-term monthly data. When considering rain gage data, make sure that they provide good coverage over the area of interest, especially if there are large changes in elevation that cause precipitation amounts to be heterogeneous within the study area. Ideally, the gauges will have at least 10 years of continuous data, with no large gaps, around the same time period as the land use/land cover map used.


Monthly reference evapotranspiration
------------------------------------

Reference evapotranspiration, :math:`ET_0`, is the energy (expressed as a depth of water, e.g. mm) supplied by the sun (and occasionally wind) to vaporize water. Reference evapotranspiration varies with elevation, latitude, humidity, and slope aspect.  There are many methodologies, which range in data requirements and precision.

Global monthly reference evapotranspiration may be obtained from the CGIAR CSI dataset (based on WorldClim data): https://cgiarcsi.community/data/global-aridity-and-pet-database/.

It is important that the precipitation data used for calculating reference evapotranspiration is the same as the precipitation data used as input to the model.

You can calculate reference ET by developing monthly average grids of precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures (also available from WorldClim and CRU) which need to incorporate the effects of elevation when interpolating from observation stations.  Data to develop these monthly precipitation and temperature grids follow the same process in the development of the 'Monthly Precipitation' grids.

A simple way to determine reference evapotranspiration is the 'modified Hargreaves' equation (Droogers and Allen, 2002), which generates superior results than the Pennman-Montieth when information is uncertain.

.. math:: ET_0 = 0.0013\times 0.408\times RA\times (T_{avg}+17)\times (TD-0.0123 P)^{0.76}

The 'modified Hargreaves' uses the average of the mean daily maximum and mean daily minimum temperatures (:math:`T_{avg}` in degrees Celsius), the difference between mean daily maximum and mean daily minimums (:math:`TD`), :math:`RA` is extraterrestrial radiation (:math:`RA` in :math:`\mathrm{MJm^{-2}d^{-1}}` and precipitation (:math:`P` in mm per month), all of which can be relatively easily obtained.  Temperature and precipitation data are often available from regional charts or direct measurement. Radiation data, on the other hand, is far more expensive to measure directly but can be reliably estimated from online tools, tables or equations. FAO Irrigation Drainage Paper 56 provides radiation data in Annex 2.

The reference evapotranspiration could be also calculated using the Hamon equation (Hamon 1961, Wolock and McCabe 1999):

.. math:: PED_{Hamon} = 13.97 d D^2W_t

where :math:`d` is the number of days in a month, :math:`D` is the mean monthly hours of daylight calculated for each year (in units of 12 hours), and :math:`W_t` is a saturated water vapor density term calculated by:

.. math:: W_t = \frac{4.95e^{0.062 T}}{100}

where :math:`T` is the monthly mean temperature in degrees Celsius. Reference evapotranspiration is set to zero when mean monthly temperature is below zero.

A final method to assess ETo, when pan evaporation data are available, is to use the following equation.

:math:`ETo = pan ET *0.7` (Allen et al., 1998)


Digital elevation model
-----------------------

DEM data is available for any area of the world, although at varying resolutions.

Free raw global DEM data is available from:

 *  The World Wildlife Fund - https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/hydrosheds
 *  NASA: \ https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp (30m resolution); and easy access to SRTM data: \ http://dwtkns.com/srtm/
 *  USGS: \ https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/

Alternatively, it may be purchased relatively inexpensively at sites such as MapMart (www.mapmart.com).

The DEM resolution may be a very important parameter depending on the project’s goals. For example, if decision makers need information about the impacts of roads on ecosystem services then fine resolution is needed. The hydrological aspects of the DEM used in the model must be correct. Most raw DEM data has errors, so it's likely that the DEM will need to be filled to remove sinks. The QGIS Wang & Liu Fill algorithm (SAGA library) or ArcGIS Fill tool have shown good results. Look closely at the stream network produced by the model (**stream.tif**.) If streams are not continuous, but broken into pieces, the DEM still has sinks that need to be filled. If filling sinks multiple times does not create a continuous stream network, perhaps try a different DEM. If the results show an unexpected grid pattern, this may be due to reprojecting the DEM with a "nearest neighbor" interpolation method instead of "bilinear" or "cubic". In this case, go back to the raw DEM data and reproject using "bilinear" or "cubic".

Also see the User Guide section **Getting Started > Working with the DEM** for more guidance about preparing this layer.


Land use/land cover
-------------------

A key component for all water models is a spatially continuous land use/land cover (LULC) raster, where all pixels must have a land use/land cover class defined. Gaps in data will create missing data (holes) in the output layers. Unknown data gaps should be approximated.

Global land use data is available from:

 *  NASA: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v006/ (MODIS multi-year global landcover data provided in several classifications)
 *  The European Space Agency: http://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/ (Three global maps for the 2000, 2005 and 2010 epochs)

Data for the U.S. is provided by the USGS and Department of the Interior via the National Land Cover Database: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database

The simplest categorization of LULCs on the landscape involves delineation by land cover only (e.g., cropland, forest, grassland). Several global and regional land cover classifications are available (e.g., Anderson et al. 1976), and often detailed land cover classification has been done for the landscape of interest.

A slightly more sophisticated LULC classification involves breaking relevant LULC types into more meaningful types. For example, agricultural land classes could be broken up into different crop types or forest could be broken up into specific species. The categorization of land use types depends on the model and how much data is available for each of the land types. You should only break up a land use type if it will provide more accuracy in modeling. For instance, only break up ‘crops’ into different crop types if you have information on the difference in evapotranspiration rates (Kc) and soil characteristics (CN) between crop management values.

Soil group
----------

Two global layers of hydrologic soil group are available, 1) from FutureWater (available at: https://www.futurewater.eu/2015/07/soil-hydraulic-properties/) and 2) ORNL-DAAC’s HYSOGs250m (available at https://daac.ornl.gov/SOILS/guides/Global_Hydrologic_Soil_Group.html.)

**The FutureWater raster** provides numeric group values 1-4 14, 24 and 34. The Seasonal Water Yield model requires only values of 1/2/3/4, so you need to convert any values of 14, 24 or 34 into one of the allowed values.

**HYSOGs250m** provides letter values A-D, A/D, B/D, C/D and D/D. For use in this model, these letter values must be translated into numeric values, where A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 and D = 4. Again, pixels with dual values like A/D, B/D etc must be converted to a value in the range of 1-4.

If desired, soil groups may also be determined from hydraulic conductivity and soil depths. FutureWater’s Soil Hydraulic Properties dataset also contains hydraulic conductivity, as may other soil databases. Table 1 below can be used to convert soil conductivity into soil groups.

In the United States free soil data is available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's NRCS gSSURGO, SSURGO and gNATSGO databases: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/soils/survey/geo/. They also provide ArcGIS tools (Soil Data Viewer for SSURGO and Soil Data Development Toolbox for gNATSGO) that help with processing these databases into spatial data that can be used by the model. The Soil Data Development Toolbox is easiest to use, and highly recommended if you use ArcGIS and need to process U.S. soil data.


Watersheds / subwatersheds
--------------------------

To delineate watersheds, we provide the InVEST tool DelineateIt, which is relatively simple yet fast and has the advantage of creating watersheds that might overlap, such as watersheds draining to several dams on the same river. See the User Guide chapter for DelineateIt for more information on this tool. Watershed creation tools are also provided with GIS software, as well as some hydrology models. It is recommended that you delineate watersheds using the DEM that you are modeling with, so the watershed boundary corresponds correctly to the topography.

Alternatively, a number of watershed maps are available online, e.g. HydroBASINS: https://hydrosheds.org/. Note that if watershed boundaries are not based on the same DEM that is being modeled, results that are aggregated to these watersheds are likely to be inaccurate.

Exact locations of specific structures, such as reservoirs, should be obtained from the managing entity or may be obtained on the web:

 * The U.S. National Inventory of Dams: https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/

 * Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database: http://globaldamwatch.org/grand/

 * World Water Development Report II dam database: https://wwdrii.sr.unh.edu/download.html

Some of these datasets include the catchment area draining to each dam, which should be compared with the area of the watershed(s) generated by the delineation tool to assess accuracy.

Biophysical table
-----------------

It is recommended to do a literature search to look for values for CN and Kc that are specific to the area you're working in. If these are not available, look for values that correspond as closely as possible to the same types of land cover/soil/climate. If none of these more local values are available, several general sources are recommended.

 * Curve numbers (fields *CN_A*, *CN_B*, *CN_C*, *CN_D*) can be obtained from the USDA handbook: (NRCS-USDA, 2007 Chap. 9)

 * Monthly Kc values (fields *Kc_1* through *Kc_12*) can be obtained from the FAO guidelines: (Allen et al., 1998)

For water bodies and wetlands that are connected to the stream, CN can be set to 99 (i.e. assuming that those pixels rapidly convey quickflow.)

When the focus is on potential flood effects, CN may be selected to reflect wet antecedent runoff conditions: CN values should then be converted to ARC-III conditions, as per Chapter 10 in NRCA-USDA guidelines (2007).

Rain events table
-----------------

The average number of monthly rain events can be obtained from local climate statistics (Bureau of Meteorology) or online resources:

 * https://www.yr.no/
 * http://wcatlas.iwmi.org
 * The World Bank also provides maps with precipitation statistics: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api

Climate zones are available from: http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm

Threshold flow accumulation
---------------------------

There is no one "correct" value for the threshold flow accumulation (TFA). The correct value for your application is the value that causes the model to create a stream layer that looks as close as possible to the real-world stream network in the watershed. Compare the model output file **stream.tif** with a known correct stream map, and adjust the TFA accordingly - larger values of TFA will create a stream network with fewer tributaries, smaller values of TFA will create a stream network with more tributaries. A good value to start with is 1000, but note that this can vary widely depending on the resolution of the DEM, local climate and topography. Also note that streams delineated from a DEM generally do not exactly match the real world, so just try to come as close as possible. If the modelled streams are very different, then consider trying a different DEM. This is an integer value, with no commas or periods - for example "1000".

A global layer of streams can be obtained from HydroSHEDS: https://hydrosheds.org/, but note that they are generally more major rivers and may not include those in your study area, especially if it has small tributaries. You can also try looking at streams in Google Earth if no more localized maps are available.

Appendix 2: :math:`{\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\beta}}_{\mathbf{i}},`\ and :math:`gamma` parameters definition and alternative values
==================================================================================================================================

:math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta_{i}` represent the fraction of annual
recharge from upslope pixels that is available to a downslope
pixel for evapotranspiration in a given month. The product
:math:`\alpha \times \beta_{i}` is expected to be <1 since some water
from upslope may be unavailable, either when it follows deep flowpaths
or when the timing of supply and (evapotranspiration) demand is not
synchronized.

:math:`\alpha` is a function of precipitation seasonality: recharge from
a given month can be used by downslope areas during later months,
depending on the subsurface travel times. In the default
parameterization, its value is set to 1/12, assuming that the soil
buffers water release and that the monthly contribution is exactly one
12\ :sup:`th` of the annual contribution. An alternative assumption is
to set values to the antecedent monthly precipitation values, relative
to the total precipitation: P\ :sub:`m-1`/P\ :sub:`annual`

:math:`\beta_{i}` is a function of local topography and soils: for a
given amount of upslope recharge, the amount of water used by a pixel is
a function of the storage capacity. It also depends on the
characteristics of the upslope area: the use of the upslope subsidy
is conditioned by the shape and area of the contribution area (i.e. the
recharge from the pixel just above the pixel of interest is less likely
to be lost than the pixels much further away)

In the default parameterization, :math:`\beta` is set to 1 for all
pixels. One alternative is to set :math:`\beta_{i}` as TI, the
topographic wetness index for a pixel, defined as
:math:`ln(\frac{A}{\text{tan}\beta}`) (or other formulation including soil
type and depth).

γ represents the fraction of pixel recharge that is available to
downslope pixels. It is a function of soil properties and possibly
topography. In the default parameterization, γ is constant over the landscape and plays a
role similar to :math:`\alpha`.

In practice
-----------

The options above are provided mainly for research purposes. In
practice, we suggest that for highly seasonal climates, *alpha* should be
set to the antecedent monthly precipitation values, relative to the
total precipitation: P\ :sub:`m-1`/P\ :sub:`annual`

Then, we offer two options to address the uncertainty around the
parameter values:

1. Verification of actual evapotranspiration with observations

The model outputs the actual evapotranspiration at the annual time
scale: users can adjust parameters to meet observed actual
evapotranspiration (e.g. from MODIS,
https://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/modis/mod16.php). In the following, "_mod" stands for modeled AET, "_obs" stands for observed AET.

*  If AET\_mod > AET\_obs, the model overpredicts evapotranspiration,
   which can be corrected by: reducing *Kc* values, or reducing *gamma*
   values, and/or *beta* values (so less water is available for each
   pixel).

*  If AET\_mod < AET\_obs, the model underpredicts evapotranspiration,
   which can be corrected by: increasing *Kc* values (and increasing *gamma*
   or *beta* values if they are not at their maximum of 1).

If monthly values of AET are available, a finer calibration can be
performed by changing the seasonal parameter alpha.

2. Ensemble modeling

The model can be run under different assumptions and the outputs
compared to estimate the effect of parameter error. Parameter ranges can
be determined from assumptions about the proportion of upslope subsidy
available to a given pixel; they can be set to the maximum bounds (0 and
1) for preliminary results.
